# smart-tutor
Research project on deep reinforcement learning methods for intelligent tutoring systems

1. n concepts (e.g. 10)
2. k exercises (e.g. 1000)


### Student Model
At any time t, a student s can be represented by the concepts she knows.
Hence, s is a n-dim vector, where each index i corresponds to concept i.
